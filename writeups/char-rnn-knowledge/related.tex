\begin{itemize}
\item Character-based language models; emphasize:
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item these models are not as good as word-based model
    perplexity-wise, but they have a more challenging task (they must
    explore a much wider possible-utterance space);
  \item lots of work on improving these models, in order to get better
    performance on morphologically rich languages etc: different from
    what we want to do, which is to probe the simplest CNLMs;
  \item Elman's might be most related in spirit, but just small toy
    experiment
  \end{inparaenum}
\item Work on discovering segmentation, in particular with CNLMs:
  clearly different
\item Work on understanding linguistic knowledge of NLMs: typically
  for word-based models
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Closer to us Alishahi et al.~2017, but they focus on a more
    complex architecture for grounded language learning, and on
    phonology
  \item Radford et al.~2017 probe CNLMs, but limited to sentement
    analysis
  \end{itemize}
\item What else?
\end{itemize}
