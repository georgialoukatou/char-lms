\section{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:setup}

Describe source corpus for each language, and how it was
pre-processed. Training/validation/test partitioning.

Hyperparameter search. LSTM vs RNN. Word-level model (was it also
optimized?)

Report results in terms of BPS on test partition, with ballpark
estimate of where we are in terms of the state of the art.
